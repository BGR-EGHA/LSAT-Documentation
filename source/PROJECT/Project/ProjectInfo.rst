   WebMap

The map shows the  projects borders (2) with `OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ as 
background. If you :doc:`imported an inventory</DATA/Import/ImportInventory>` these datasets will 
also be displayed. You can hide/show layers in the menu (1)

Information
^^^^^^^^^^^

The general information (1) shows a slightly modified and embedded version of the 
:doc:`Raster Info Widget</PROJECT/View/RasterInfo>` for the mask raster dataset (region.tif).

WebMap requires an internet connection to display the 
`OpenStreetMap <https://www.openstreetmap.org>`_ layer.

The WebMap is stored in /workspace/\*project name\*.html. It is independent of LSAT so it can be 
shared among peers and colleagues.
