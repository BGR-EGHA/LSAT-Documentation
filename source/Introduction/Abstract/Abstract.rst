Abstract
--------

The Landslide Susceptibility Assessment Tools â€“ Project Manager Suite (LSAT PMS) provides a 
framework for conducting landslide susceptibility analyses on regional scales based on heuristic 
and statistical approaches and machine learning algorithms. However, the application is not 
limited to this issue and applies to any supervised binary classification analysis with spatial 
data. The current version of LSAT PMS incorporates algorithms for heuristic Analytical Hierarchy 
Process (AHP), bivariate statistical analysis with Weights of Evidence (WoE), and multivariate 
statistical analysis/ machine learning with Logistic regression (LR) and artificial neural 
networks (ANN).
