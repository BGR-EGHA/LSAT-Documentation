Uninstall
---------

To uninstall LSAT PMS simply delete the folder. LSAT does not write into the windows registry or 
stores data outside its folder, besides the projects.

If you uninstalled LSAT, because it lacks features or something does not work correctly, please 
let us know, so we can fix/enhance it.
